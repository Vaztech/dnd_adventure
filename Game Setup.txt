## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the D\&D Adventure Game on a New Device

### 1. **Install Python**

Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your system.

* **Windows**: Download from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, check the box to "Add Python to PATH."

* **macOS/Linux**: Python is typically pre-installed. To verify, run:

  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

  If not installed, use:

  * **macOS**: `brew install python`
  * **Linux**: `sudo apt install python3`

### 2. **Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vaztech/dnd_adventure.git
cd dnd_adventure
```

### 3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

* **Windows**:

  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  .\.venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

* **macOS/Linux**:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. **Install Dependencies**

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, manually install necessary packages, such as:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### 5. **Run the Game**

Start the game by executing:

```bash
python -m dnd_adventure.game
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to create your character, select a race, and choose a class.
